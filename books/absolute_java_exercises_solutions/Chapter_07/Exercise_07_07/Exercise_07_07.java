/**
 * 7. Give the definition of two classes, Patient and Billing, whose objects are records
 * for a clinic. Patient will be derived from the class Person given in Programming
 * Project 7.6. A Patient record has the patientâ€™s name (inherited from the class
 * Person) and primary physician of type Doctor defined in Programming Project 7.5
 * A Billing object will contain a Patient object, a Doctor object, and an amount
 * due of type double. Be sure your classes have a reasonable complement of constructors,
 * accessor and mutator methods, and suitably defined equals and toString
 * methods. First write a driver program to test all your methods, then write a test
 * program that creates at least two patients, at least two doctors, and at least two
 * Billing records, and then prints out the total income from the Billing records.
