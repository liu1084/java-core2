/**
 * 6. Create a class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type String),
 * number of cylinders in the engine (type int), and owner (type Person given
 * next). Then, create a class called Truck that is derived from Vehicle and has the
 * following additional properties: the load capacity in tons (type double since it may
 * contain a fractional part) and towing capacity in pounds (type int). Be sure your
 * class has a reasonable complement of constructors, accessor and mutator methods,
 * and suitably defined equals and toString methods. Write a program to test all
 * your methods.
 *  The definition of the class Person follows. Completing the definitions of the
 * methods is part of this programming project.
 * public class Person
 * {
 *  private String name;
 *  public Person()
 *  {...}
 *  public Person(String theName)
 *  {...}
 *  public Person(Person theObject)
 *  {...}
 *  public String getName()
 *  {...}
 *  public void setName(String theName)
 *  {...}
 *  public String toString()
 *  {...}
 *  public boolean equals(Object other)
 *  {...}
 * }
