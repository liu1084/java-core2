/**
 * 8. Create a threaded chat server and a corresponding chat client. Using the port of
 * your choice, create a server that starts a new thread for every client that connects to
 * it. Every message that the server receives from a client should be broadcast back to
 * all other clients. The chat client should allow the user to type in a string of text and
 * have it sent to the server upon pressing enter. Use threads on the client so messages
 * can be retrieved from the server and displayed even while the user is typing. Test
 * your server by connecting to it with multiple clients and verifying that messages
 * are transmitted back and forth.
