/**
 * 11. Create an HTML form that serves as a random baby name generator. The form
 * should prompt the user to enter a last name. When the form is submitted, a JSP
 * Web page should run that randomly picks the first name of a boy and the first
 * name of a girl and then outputs the random first names coupled with the entered
 * last name. For example, if the last name entered is “Savitch” and if the JSP program
 * randomly selects “Emma” as the girl name and “Homer” as the boy name, then the
 * output would be
 * If your baby is a boy, consider the name Homer Savitch.
 * If your baby is a girl, consider the name Emma Savitch.
 *  The boy and girl names should be randomly selected from the files boynames.txt
 * and girlnames.txt that are included in the source code on the website for this book.
 *  These files contain the 1,000 most popular boy and girl names in the United States
 * for the year 2003 as compiled by the Social Security Administration.
