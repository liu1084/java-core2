/**
 * 9. Displays 15.34 and 15.35 provide the beginnings of a spell-checker. Refine the
 * program to make it more useful. The modified program should read in a text file, parse
 * each word, see if it is in the hash table, and, if not, output the line number and
 * word of the potentially misspelled word. Discard any punctuation in the original
 * text file. Use the words.txt file as the basis for the hash table dictionary. This file
 * can be found on the bookâ€™s website. The file contains 87,314 words in the English
 * language. Test your spell-checker on a short text document.
