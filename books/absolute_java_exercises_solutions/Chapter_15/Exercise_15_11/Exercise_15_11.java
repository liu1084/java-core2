/**
 * 11. The following figure is called a graph. The circles are called nodes and the lines are
 * called edges. An edge connects two nodes. You can interpret the graph as a maze of
 * rooms and passages. The nodes can be thought of as rooms, and an edge connects one
 * room to another. Note that each node has at most four edges in the graph that follows.
 *
 * Write a program that implements the previous maze using references to instances
 * of a Node class. Each node in the graph will correspond to an instance of Node.
 * The edges correspond to links that connect one node to another and can be
 * represented in Node as instance variables that reference another Node class. Start
 * the user in node A. The userâ€™s goal is to reach the finish in node L. The program
 * should output possible moves in the north, south, east, or west direction. Sample
 * execution is shown next.
 * You are in room A of a maze of twisty little passages, all
 * alike. You can go east or south.
 * E
 * You are in room B of a maze of twisty little passages, all
 * alike. You can go west or south.
 * S
 * You are in room F of a maze of twisty little passages, all
 * alike. You can go north or east.
 * E
