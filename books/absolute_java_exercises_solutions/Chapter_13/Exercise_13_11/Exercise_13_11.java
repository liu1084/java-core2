/**
 * 11. Create a Student class that has instance variables for the studentâ€™s last name and
 * ID number, along with appropriate constructors, accessors, and mutators. Make the
 * Student class implement the Comparable interface. Define the compareTo method
 * to order Student objects based on the student ID number. In the main method,
 * create an array of at least five Student objects, sort them using Arrays.sort, and
 * output the students. They should be listed by ascending student number. Next,
 * modify the compareTo method so it orders Student objects based on the
 * lexicographic ordering of their last name. Without modification to the main method, the
 * program should now output the students ordered by name.
