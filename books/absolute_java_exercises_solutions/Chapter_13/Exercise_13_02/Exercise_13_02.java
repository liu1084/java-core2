/**
 * 2. Listed next is the skeleton for a class named City. Each city has a name and temperature:
 * class City
 * {
 * private String cityName;
 * private double temperature;
 * }
 *  Flesh out the class with appropriate accessors, constructors, and mutators.
 *  The temperatures are assigned by you and can be set from outside the City classâ€”your
 *  code does not have to ensure that they are unique. Next, modify the class so that
 * it implements the Comparable interface. The class also overrides the compareTo
 * method. This method imposes an order between instances of the City class
 * depending upon their temperature. Test your class by creating an array of sample
 * temperatures and sort them in an ascending order using a sorting method that takes
 * as input an array of type Comparable.
