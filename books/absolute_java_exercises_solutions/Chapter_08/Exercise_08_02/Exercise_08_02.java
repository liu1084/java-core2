/**
 * 2. Create a class named Employee that can be used to calculate the salaries of different
 * employees. The Employee class should keep a track of the employee ID, name,
 * department, salary, and designation with appropriate accessor and mutator methods.
 * Also create an equals() method that overrides Objectâ€™s equals() method,
 * where employees can check if their designation is identical. Next, create two
 * additional classes named Manager and Clerk that are derived from Employee. Create an
 * overridden method named addBonus that returns the salary of the employee after
 * adding up the bonus. There is a default bonus of $200/month. Managers have a
 * bonus of $300/month and clerks have a bonus of $100/month. Finally create a
 * display method to print the details of the employee. You may assume the initial salary
 * of an employee and other necessary values. Test your classes from a main method
