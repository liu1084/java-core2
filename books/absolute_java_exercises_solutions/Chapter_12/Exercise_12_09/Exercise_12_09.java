/**
 * 9. Use the sorting pattern to implement insertion sort. In insertion sort, the split
 * method always returns the value (end â€” 1). This results in splitting the array
 * into two pieces, one with a single value at the end of the array and the other with
 * everything else. The join method does more work. A precondition for entry into
 * join is that the elements from a[begin] to a[end-1] will be in sorted order. The
 * method should insert a[end] into the correct spot from a[begin] to a[end] such
 * that sorted order is maintained. For example, if array a contains {2, 4, 6, 8, 5}
 * where begin = 0 and end = 4, then a[end] = 5 and the method should insert the
 * value 5 between the 4 and 6, resulting in {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}. This entails copying
 * the 6 and 8 one element to the right and then copying the value 5 to index 2.
