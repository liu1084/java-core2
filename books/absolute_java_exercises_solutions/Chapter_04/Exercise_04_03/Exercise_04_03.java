/**
 * 3. Define a class called Vehicle that will be used to check the amount of fuel left in a
 * vehicle after traveling a certain distance. The class should have the instance variable
 * tankSize to store the initial size of the tank and efficiency to store initial efficiency
 * of the vehicle. Set to zero the variable fuelInTank that is used to store the initial
 * amount of fuel in a tank. Include a mutator method that returns iniTankSize,
 * initEfficiency and fuelInTank. Include an accessor method addPetrol that
 * calculates how much fuel can be filled depending on the fuel existing in the tank
 * and the tankâ€™s capacity. Also, include a method driveTo that returns what distance
 * can be traveled with the available fuel and provided efficiency. Use your class with
 * a test program. You should decide which variables should be public, if any. Also,
 * define if any other method(s) are needed.
