 * 4. Define a class called Journal that could be used to store an entry for a research
 * paper that will be published. The class should have instance variables to store the
 * authorâ€™s name, title of the paper, and the date of submission using the Date class
 * from this chapter. Add a constructor to the class that allows the user of the class
 * to set all instance variables. Also add a method, displayDetails, that outputs all
 * the instance variables, and another method called getSubmissionDetails that
 * returns the title of the paper, with the first letter of each word capitalized. Test your
 * class from the main method
