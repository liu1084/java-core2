/**
 * 3. The birthday paradox is that there is a surprisingly high probability that two or
 * more people in the same room happen to share the same birthday. By birthday,
 * we mean the same day of the year (ignoring leap years), but not the exact birthday
 * that includes the birth year or time of day. Write a program that approximates the
 * probability that 2 or more people in the same room have the same birthday, for
 * 2 to 50 people in the room.
 *  The program should use simulation to approximate the answer. Over many trials
 * (say, 5,000), randomly assign birthdays (i.e., a number from 1â€“365) to everyone
 * in the room. Use a HashSet to store the birthdays. As the birthdays are randomly
 * generated, use the contains method of a HashSet to see if someone with the same
 * birthday is already in the room. If so, increment a counter that tracks how many
 * times at least two people have the same birthday and then move on to the next trial.
 * After the trials are over, divide the counter by the number of trials to get an estimated
 * probability that two or more people share the same birthday for a given room size.
 *  Your output should look something like the following. It will not be exactly the
 * same due to the random numbers:
 *  For 2 people, the probability of two birthdays is about 0.002
 *  For 3 people, the probability of two birthdays is about 0.0082
 *  For 4 people, the probability of two birthdays is about 0.0163
 *  ...
 *  For 49 people, the probability of two birthdays is about 0.9654
 *  For 50 people, the probability of two birthdays is about 0.969
