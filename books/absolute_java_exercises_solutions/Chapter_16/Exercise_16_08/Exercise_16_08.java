/**
 * 8. You have collected a file of faculty where each faculty member is rated 1 (lowest)
 * to 5 (highest). The first line of the file is a number that identifies how many rating
 * entries are in the file. Each rating then consists of two lines: the unique ID of the
 * faculty followed by the numeric rating from 1 to 5. Here is a sample rating file with
 * three unique faculty IDs and six ratings:
 * 8
 * Eve_8640
 * 5
 * Kate_6721
 * 5
 * Eve_8640
 * 3
 * Rex_5432
 * 4
 * Eve_8640
 * 1
 * Kate_6721
 * 2
 * Rex_5432
 * 2
 * Kate_6721
 * 1
 *  Write a program that reads a file in this format, calculates the average rating for
 * each faculty member, and outputs the average along with the number of reviews.
 * Here is the desired output for the sample data:
 * Eve_8640: 3 reviews, average of 3.0 / 5
 * Kate_6721: 3 reviews, average of 2.6 / 5
 * Rex_5432: 2 reviews, average of 3.0 / 5
 *  Use an ArrayList to calculate the output. Your map(s) should index from a string
 * representing each faculty memberâ€™s name to integers that store the number of
 * reviews for the faculty ID and the sum of the ratings for the faculty memb
