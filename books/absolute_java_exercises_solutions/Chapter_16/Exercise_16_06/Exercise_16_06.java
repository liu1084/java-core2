/**
 * 6. In a fairyland, the beautiful daughter Laura of the King Charles decided to marry.
 * To help her choose from the many suitors she decided on the following procedure.
 * First, all of the suitors would be lined up one after the other and assigned numbers.
 * The first suitor would be number 1, the second number 2, and so on up to the last
 * suitor, number n. For our implementation letâ€™s consider the value of n to be 56.
 * Starting from the first suitor, she would then count five suitors down the line and
 * the fifth suitor would be eliminated from winning her hand and removed from the
 * line. Laura would then continue, counting five more suitors, and eliminating every
 * fifth suitor. When she reaches the end of the line, she would reverse direction and
 * work her way back to the beginning. Similarly on reaching the first person in line,
 * she would reverse direction and make her way to the end of the line.
 *  For example, if there were five suitors, then the elimination process would
 * proceed as follows:
 *  12345 Initial list of suitors; start counting from 1.
 *  1234 Suitor 5 eliminated; bounce from end back to 1 and keep counting.
 *
 *  234 Suitor 1 eliminated; continue counting back from 2.
 *  24 Next, Suitor 3 is eliminated; the counting is continued.
 *  2 Suitor 4 is eliminated; 2 is the lucky winner.
 *  Write a program that uses an ArrayList or Vector to determine which position
 * you should stand in to marry Laura if there are n suitors. Your program should
 * use the Listiterator interface to traverse the list of suitors and remove a suitor.
 * Be sure that you iterate references the proper object while bouncing back to the
 * beginning of the list of suitors. The suitor at the start of the list should only be
 * counted once when Laura reverses the count.
