/**
 * 10. You have a list of student ID numbers followed by the course number (separated
 * by a space) that each student is enrolled in. The listing is in no particular order.
 * For example, if student 1 is in CS100 and CS200 while student 2 is in CS105 and
 * MATH210, then the list might look like this:
 *  1 CS100
 *  2 MATH210
 *  2 CS105
 *  1 CS200
 *  Write a program that reads data in this format from the console. If the ID number
 * is âˆ’1, then stop inputting data. Use the HashMap class to map from an Integer
 * (the student ID number) to an ArrayList of type String that holds each course
 * that the student is enrolled in. The declaration should look like this:
 *  HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<String>> students =
 *  new HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<String>>();
 *  After all the data is input, iterate through the map and output the student ID
 * number and all courses stored in the vector for that student. The result should be
 * a list of courses organized by student ID number.
